# Overview
This repository contains the MATLAB and python codes used to analyze the data and generate the figures in Hoseini et al., Transplanted cells are essential for the induction but not the expression of cortical plasticity (2019).

Our primary goal was to publish the actual code that we used to analyze the pre-processed data and create the figures, to provide full transparency and to enable readers to read it and find out the exact details of what was done.

To simplify the usage of the codes, we have provided the pre-processed matrix of data (i.e. separating different conditions including ipsi- vs. contra-lateral eye, running vs. still, and light off vs. light on). Running the code yourself to reproduce the figures or build upon it is easy.
